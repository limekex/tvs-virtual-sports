# Release Notes - v0.1.23

## üéâ Summary
This release introduces major improvements to activity session management, adds a reusable "My Activities" component, and replaces all alert dialogs with elegant flash notifications. The Vimeo Player issue preventing programmatic playback has been fixed.

## ‚úÖ Test Results

### Automated Tests
```

OK (7 tests, 15 assertions)
```

### Manual Testing
See [MANUAL_TESTING.md](./MANUAL_TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing checklist.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. Activity Session Management
**Problem Solved**: Previously, stopping an activity immediately saved it. Users needed the ability to pause and resume without saving.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented three-button workflow: Pause, Resume, Finish & Save
- Pause stops the session without saving
- Resume continues from paused position, preserving session start time
- Finish & Save creates the activity with cumulative duration

**Technical Details**:
- Session start time (`sessionStartAt`) preserved across pause/resume cycles
- Cumulative duration calculation works correctly
- Video playback synchronized with session state

### 2. Vimeo Player Fix
**Problem**: Video loaded but wouldn't play when clicking "Start" button. The operation would hang indefinitely.

**Root Cause**: `await player.setCurrentTime(0)` was blocking execution. The promise never resolved.

**Solution**: Removed `await` from `setCurrentTime(0)` call. Video now plays immediately without waiting for the seek operation to complete.

```javascript
// Before (blocked)
await player.setCurrentTime(0);
await player.play();

// After (works)
player.setCurrentTime(0); // Don't await
player.play(); // Executes immediately
```

### 3. My Activities Component
**Problem**: Activities list was embedded in route block, couldn't be placed elsewhere.

**Solution**: Created standalone component available as both Gutenberg block and shortcode.

**Features**:
- Shows 5 most recent activities
- Compact design with activity name format: "Route name (Oct 27, 2025)"
- Strava sync status with visual indicators (‚úì checkmark + S button)
- Auto-refresh via global event system
- Works in any page/template

**Usage**:
- Gutenberg: Search for "TVS My Activities" block
- Shortcode: Add `[tvs_my_activities]` anywhere

### 4. Flash Notifications
**Problem**: Browser `alert()` dialogs are intrusive and block the UI.

**Solution**: Elegant slide-in notifications that auto-fade after 3 seconds.

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Global flash function available everywhere
window.tvsFlash(message, type);

// Examples
window.tvsFlash("Activity saved!"); // Success (green)
window.tvsFlash("Upload failed", "error"); // Error (red)
```

**Features**:
- Smooth CSS animations (slide in from top-right)
- Green for success, red for errors
- Auto-fade after 3 seconds
- Non-blocking - users can continue working
- Works across all components (main app + standalone blocks)

### 5. Enhanced Activity Metadata
**New Fields**:
- `route_name`: Stored when activity is created
- `activity_date`: ISO timestamp of activity creation

**Display Format**: "Eik Forest Trail (Oct 27, 2025)" instead of "Activity #123"

**Benefits**:
- Easier to identify activities at a glance
- Better user experience in activity lists
- More meaningful activity cards

### 6. Auto-Refresh System
**Problem**: After saving/uploading, activity lists didn't update without page reload.

**Solution**: Global event system using CustomEvents.

**Technical Details**:
```javascript
// Trigger event after save/upload
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('tvs:activity-updated'));

// All components listen for the event
window.addEventListener('tvs:activity-updated', loadActivities);
```

**Result**: All "My Activities" blocks/shortcodes on the page refresh automatically when:
- New activity is saved
- Activity is uploaded to Strava
- Activity metadata changes
